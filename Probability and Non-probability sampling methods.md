# Probability and Non-probability sampling methods

**Probability Sampling Methods:**

In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. This method is often used when the goal is to produce representative samples and make inferences about the population. Here are a few common probability sampling methods:

1. **Simple Random Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
   - **Example:** If a company wants to survey its employees, they can assign a number to each employee and use a random number generator to select participants.

2. **Systematic Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Every nth member of the population is selected after a random start.
   - **Example:** A researcher selects every 10th person on a list of registered voters to conduct a political opinion survey.

3. **Stratified Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and a random sample is taken from each stratum.
   - **Example:** A school wants to ensure that students from each grade level are represented in a survey about cafeteria food. They divide the student body by grade and randomly select a proportional number of students from each grade.

4. **Cluster Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into clusters, usually based on geographical areas or natural groupings, and a random sample of clusters is selected. Then, all or a random sample of members from chosen clusters are surveyed.
   - **Example:** A researcher wants to study the educational attainment in a large city. They divide the city into districts (clusters), randomly select a few districts, and then survey all households within those selected districts.

**Non-Probability Sampling Methods:**

In non-probability sampling, not all members of the population have a known or equal chance of being selected. This method is often used when the focus is on specific characteristics, or when probability sampling is impractical. Here are a few common non-probability sampling methods:

1. **Convenience Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Participants are selected based on their availability and willingness to take part.
   - **Example:** A researcher stands outside a mall and surveys people who pass by. 

2. **Judgmental or Purposive Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Participants are selected based on the researcherâ€™s knowledge and judgment.
   - **Example:** To study the impact of a new teaching method, a researcher selects only those teachers who have been using the method for at least six months.

3. **Snowball Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.
   - **Example:** A researcher studying a rare disease starts with a few known patients and asks them to refer others who also have the disease.

4. **Quota Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into subgroups, and a specific number (quota) of participants is chosen from each subgroup, typically based on convenience.
   - **Example:** A market researcher wants to ensure a certain number of responses from different age groups for a product survey and interviews people until the quota for each age group is met.

**Summary:**

- **Probability Sampling:** More representative, allows for generalization, includes methods like simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling.
- **Non-Probability Sampling:** More practical in some situations, includes methods like convenience, judgmental, snowball, and quota sampling.

Stratified and cluster sampling might seem similar because both involve dividing the population into groups, but they differ significantly in their approaches and purposes. Here are the key differences:

### Stratified Sampling:
- **Division Criteria:** The population is divided into strata (subgroups) based on specific characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income level).
- **Purpose:** To ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample, which improves the precision of the sample.
- **Selection Process:** A random sample is taken from each stratum. The number of samples from each stratum can be proportional or equal, depending on the research goals.
- **Example:** A researcher wants to understand students' satisfaction with school facilities and ensures that students from each grade (stratum) are proportionally represented in the sample.

### Cluster Sampling:
- **Division Criteria:** The population is divided into clusters, often based on geographical areas or naturally occurring groups.
- **Purpose:** To make sampling more practical and cost-effective, especially when the population is large and spread out.
- **Selection Process:** A random sample of clusters is selected first. Then, either all members of the chosen clusters are included in the sample (one-stage cluster sampling) or a random sample of members within each selected cluster is taken (two-stage cluster sampling).
- **Example:** A researcher studying the educational attainment in a large city might divide the city into districts (clusters), randomly select a few districts, and then survey all households within those selected districts.

### Key Differences:
- **Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity:** In stratified sampling, strata are created so that each stratum is internally homogeneous (members are similar to each other) but different from other strata. In cluster sampling, clusters are created so that each cluster is heterogeneous (reflecting the diversity of the population) but clusters themselves are similar to each other.
- **Selection Levels:** Stratified sampling involves random selection at one level (within strata), while cluster sampling can involve random selection at two levels (clusters first, then members within clusters).
- **Purpose:** Stratified sampling aims to improve representativeness and precision, while cluster sampling aims to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Visual Representation:
- **Stratified Sampling:**
  - Imagine a layered cake with different flavors (strata) in each layer. You take a slice from each layer to ensure every flavor is represented in your sample.
- **Cluster Sampling:**
  - Imagine a city map divided into neighborhoods (clusters). You randomly pick a few neighborhoods and survey everyone in those selected neighborhoods or a random sample from within those neighborhoods.

Understanding these differences helps in choosing the appropriate sampling method based on the research objectives, resources, and population characteristics.
