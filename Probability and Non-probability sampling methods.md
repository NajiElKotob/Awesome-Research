# Probability and Non-probability sampling methods

**Probability Sampling Methods:**

In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. This method is often used when the goal is to produce representative samples and make inferences about the population. Here are a few common probability sampling methods:

1. **Simple Random Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
   - **Example:** If a company wants to survey its employees, they can assign a number to each employee and use a random number generator to select participants.

2. **Systematic Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Every nth member of the population is selected after a random start.
   - **Example:** A researcher selects every 10th person on a list of registered voters to conduct a political opinion survey.

3. **Stratified Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and a random sample is taken from each stratum.
   - **Example:** A school wants to ensure that students from each grade level are represented in a survey about cafeteria food. They divide the student body by grade and randomly select a proportional number of students from each grade.

4. **Cluster Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into clusters, usually based on geographical areas or natural groupings, and a random sample of clusters is selected. Then, all or a random sample of members from chosen clusters are surveyed.
   - **Example:** A researcher wants to study the educational attainment in a large city. They divide the city into districts (clusters), randomly select a few districts, and then survey all households within those selected districts.

**Non-Probability Sampling Methods:**

In non-probability sampling, not all members of the population have a known or equal chance of being selected. This method is often used when the focus is on specific characteristics, or when probability sampling is impractical. Here are a few common non-probability sampling methods:

1. **Convenience Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Participants are selected based on their availability and willingness to take part.
   - **Example:** A researcher stands outside a mall and surveys people who pass by. 

2. **Judgmental or Purposive Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Participants are selected based on the researcherâ€™s knowledge and judgment.
   - **Example:** To study the impact of a new teaching method, a researcher selects only those teachers who have been using the method for at least six months.

3. **Snowball Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.
   - **Example:** A researcher studying a rare disease starts with a few known patients and asks them to refer others who also have the disease.

4. **Quota Sampling:**
   - **Description:** The population is divided into subgroups, and a specific number (quota) of participants is chosen from each subgroup, typically based on convenience.
   - **Example:** A market researcher wants to ensure a certain number of responses from different age groups for a product survey and interviews people until the quota for each age group is met.

**Summary:**

- **Probability Sampling:** More representative, allows for generalization, includes methods like simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling.
- **Non-Probability Sampling:** More practical in some situations, includes methods like convenience, judgmental, snowball, and quota sampling.
