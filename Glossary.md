# Glossary
* **Sampling proportion** refers to the practice of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population to estimate the proportion of a specific characteristic within the entire population. It involves randomly selecting samples to represent the population accurately, ensuring statistical validity in studies or surveys. For example, if you're studying the proportion of people who prefer a certain brand of coffee, you might sample a group of individuals and analyze what proportion of them favor that brand.
* The **central limit theorem** says that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough. Regardless of whether the population has a normal, Poisson, binomial, or any other distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.

  -  The more sample we take, the closer the mean of our sample means will bet to the population mean.
* **Standard deviation** is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It indicates how much individual data points differ from the mean (average) of the data set. A low standard deviation means that the data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range.
* An **unbiased sample** means that every member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. There is no systematic favoring of certain outcomes or groups over others. Explanation: In an unbiased sample, the selection process is fair and impartial. For instance, if you were to randomly select names from a hat containing the names of every student in a school, each student would have an equal chance of being chosen. This ensures that the sample accurately represents the population, reducing the risk of skewed or misleading results.
* “**research** is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict, and control the observed phenomenon. It involves inductive and deductive methods.” Inductive استقرائية methods analyze an observed event, while deductive استنتاجية methods verify the observed event. Inductive approaches are associated with qualitative research, and deductive methods are more commonly associated with quantitative analysis.

* The **research lifecycle** covers everything from the conception of a research idea through securing funding for it, building the team, partnerships or collaborators who will work on it with you, taking the project to completion and then beyond communication and dissemination to **impact**.

* In a **longitudinal study**, researchers repeatedly examine the same individuals to detect any changes that might occur over a period of time. Longitudinal studies are a type of correlational research in which researchers observe and collect data on a number of variables without trying to influence those variables.

* **Ethnography** is a qualitative method for collecting data often used in the social and behavioral sciences. Data are collected through observations and interviews, which are then used to draw conclusions about how societies and individuals function.
