### 1. Initial Planning
`Initial planning is a crucial stage in the research process, as it sets the foundation for the entire study. This phase involves identifying the research problem, defining objectives, and planning the research design and methodology.`
#### Research Problem
#### Research Objectives
#### Research Questions or Hypotheses
#### Literature Review
* [What is a Literature Review?](https://content.bridgepointeducation.com/curriculum/file/bdd26ae5-871f-489f-8d46-d47aaac1885e/1/Sample%20Literature%20Review.pdf)

#### Research Design
#### Feasibility Analysis
#### Ethical Considerations

### 2. Research Design
`Research design is a framework or blueprint for conducting the research project. It outlines the procedures for every step of the research process, including data collection, measurement, and analysis. The research design ensures that the study will be able to answer the research questions or test the hypotheses in a systematic, reliable, and valid manner.`

#### Type of Research
`Descriptive, correlational, experimental, or exploratory.`
* [Types of research design: Choosing the right methods for your study](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/types-of-research-design/) - surveymonkey.com
#### Variables
`Identification and operationalization of independent, dependent, and control variables.`
#### Research Setting
`The context in which the research will take place (e.g., laboratory, field, online).`
#### Data Collection Techniques
`Methods used to gather data (e.g., surveys, interviews, observations).`
#### Time Frame
`Cross-sectional (data collected at one point in time) or longitudinal (data collected over an extended period).`


### 3. Methodological Approach
`The methodological approach outlines the overall strategy and specific methods that will be used to collect and analyze data in a research study. It details whether the study will use qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, and it explains the rationale behind the chosen approach. The methodological approach ensures that the research design is implemented effectively and that the data collected will be suitable for answering the research questions or testing the hypotheses.`

### 4. Data Collection Methods
`Data collection methods refer to the techniques and tools used to gather information from participants or sources for the purpose of answering research questions or testing hypotheses. The choice of data collection methods depends on the research design, objectives, and the nature of the data needed.`

### 5. Sampling Techniques
`Sampling techniques are the methods used to select a subset of individuals, groups, or cases from a larger population to participate in a research study. The chosen sample should be representative of the population to ensure the generalizability of the findings. Sampling techniques are critical in determining the accuracy and reliability of the study’s results.`

### 6. Data Preparation
`Data preparation involves the process of cleaning, organizing, and structuring data before it is analyzed. This step ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and suitable for analysis. Effective data preparation helps in minimizing errors and biases, leading to more reliable and valid research results.`

### 7. Data Analysis
`Data analysis involves examining, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It includes applying various statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques to summarize, describe, and evaluate the data collected during the research.`

### 8. Ensuring Validity and Reliability
### 9. Ethical Considerations
### 10. Reporting and Dissemination
`Reporting and dissemination involve sharing the research findings with a broader audience, ensuring that the results are accessible, understandable, and useful. This includes writing research reports, presenting findings at conferences, publishing in academic journals, and using other platforms to communicate the results.`

* [Reporting a multiple linear regression in APA](https://www.slideshare.net/plummer48/reporting-a-multiple-linear-regression-in-apa)
* The 6th edition of the APA style manual (American Psychological Association, 2010) states the following on the topic of reporting p-values: “When reporting p values, report exact p values (e.g., p = .031) to two or three decimal places. However, report p values less than .001 as p < .001. The tradition of reporting p values in the form p < .10, p < .05, p < .01, and so forth, was appropriate in a time when only limited tables of critical values were available.” [What a p-value tells you about statistical significance](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html)
