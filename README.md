### 1. Initial Planning
`Initial planning is a crucial stage in the research process, as it sets the foundation for the entire study. This phase involves identifying the research problem, defining objectives, and planning the research design and methodology.`
#### Research Problem
`A research problem is a specific issue or gap in existing knowledge that you aim to address in your research. You may choose to look for practical problems aimed at contributing to change, or theoretical problems aimed at expanding knowledge.`
* [How to Define a Research Problem | Ideas & Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-problem/) - scribbr.com
  
#### Research Objectives
`Research objectives describe what your research is trying to achieve and explain why you are pursuing it. They summarize the approach and purpose of your project and help to focus your research.`
* [Research Objectives | Definition & Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-objectives/) - scribbr.com


  
#### Research Questions or Hypotheses
`A research question pinpoints exactly what you want to find out in your work. A good research question is essential to guide your research paper, dissertation, or thesis.` + `A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested by scientific research. If you want to test a relationship between two or more variables, you need to write hypotheses before you start your experiment or data collection.`

#### Literature Review
`A literature review discusses and analyses published information in a particular subject area.   Sometimes the information covers a certain time period. A literature review is more than a summary of the sources, it has an organizational pattern that combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organization, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new interpretation of old material or combine new with old interpretations.` [Learn more](https://libguides.wustl.edu/our?p=302677)

#### Research Design
* A research design is a strategy for answering your research question using empirical data. Creating a research design means making decisions about: [Learn more](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/research-design/)
  - Your overall research objectives and approach
  - Whether you’ll rely on primary research or secondary research
  - Your sampling methods or criteria for selecting subjects
  - Your data collection methods
  - The procedures you’ll follow to collect data
  - Your data analysis methods

#### Feasibility Analysis
#### Ethical Considerations
`Ethical considerations in research are a set of principles that guide your research designs and practices. These principles include voluntary participation, informed consent, anonymity, confidentiality, potential for harm, and results communication.` [Learn more](https://www.scribbr.com/frequently-asked-questions/what-are-ethical-considerations-in-research/#)


### 2. Research Design
`Research design is a framework or blueprint for conducting the research project. It outlines the procedures for every step of the research process, including data collection, measurement, and analysis. The research design ensures that the study will be able to answer the research questions or test the hypotheses in a systematic, reliable, and valid manner.`

#### Type of Research
`Descriptive, correlational, experimental, or exploratory.`
* [Types of research design: Choosing the right methods for your study](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/types-of-research-design/) - surveymonkey.com
#### Variables
`Identification and operationalization of independent, dependent, and control variables.`
#### Research Setting
`The context in which the research will take place (e.g., laboratory, field, online).`
#### Data Collection Techniques
`Methods used to gather data (e.g., surveys, interviews, observations).`
#### Time Frame
`Cross-sectional (data collected at one point in time) or longitudinal (data collected over an extended period).`


### 3. Methodological Approach
`The methodological approach outlines the overall strategy and specific methods that will be used to collect and analyze data in a research study. It details whether the study will use qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, and it explains the rationale behind the chosen approach. The methodological approach ensures that the research design is implemented effectively and that the data collected will be suitable for answering the research questions or testing the hypotheses.`

### 4. Data Collection Methods
`Data collection methods refer to the techniques and tools used to gather information from participants or sources for the purpose of answering research questions or testing hypotheses. The choice of data collection methods depends on the research design, objectives, and the nature of the data needed.`

### 5. Sampling Techniques
`Sampling techniques are the methods used to select a subset of individuals, groups, or cases from a larger population to participate in a research study. The chosen sample should be representative of the population to ensure the generalizability of the findings. Sampling techniques are critical in determining the accuracy and reliability of the study’s results.` [learn more](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/sampling-methods/)
#### Population vs. sample
* [Population vs. Sample | Definitions, Differences & Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/population-vs-sample/)
#### Sampling frame
`A sampling frame is a researcher’s list or device to specify the population of interest. It’s a group of components that a researcher can use to select a sample from the population. e.g.,
Imagine a researcher wants to study the satisfaction levels of students at a university. The sampling frame could be the university’s enrollment database, which lists all current students. The researcher can use this list to randomly select a sample of students to survey about their satisfaction.`

### 6. Data Preparation
`Data preparation involves the process of cleaning, organizing, and structuring data before it is analyzed. This step ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and suitable for analysis. Effective data preparation helps in minimizing errors and biases, leading to more reliable and valid research results.`

### 7. Data Analysis
`Data analysis involves examining, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It includes applying various statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques to summarize, describe, and evaluate the data collected during the research.`

### 8. Ensuring Validity and Reliability
`Validity and reliability are critical aspects of any research study, ensuring that the results are accurate and can be trusted. Validity refers to the extent to which the research measures what it intends to measure, while reliability refers to the consistency and stability of the measurement over time.`

### 9. Ethical Considerations
`Ethical considerations in research involve ensuring that the study is conducted in a manner that respects the rights, dignity, and welfare of the participants. This includes obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality and privacy, minimizing harm, and ensuring the integrity of the research process.`

### 10. Reporting and Dissemination
`Reporting and dissemination involve sharing the research findings with a broader audience, ensuring that the results are accessible, understandable, and useful. This includes writing research reports, presenting findings at conferences, publishing in academic journals, and using other platforms to communicate the results.`

* The 6th edition of the APA style manual (American Psychological Association, 2010) states the following on the topic of reporting p-values: “When reporting p values, report exact p values (e.g., p = .031) to two or three decimal places. However, report p values less than .001 as p < .001. The tradition of reporting p values in the form p < .10, p < .05, p < .01, and so forth, was appropriate in a time when only limited tables of critical values were available.” [What a p-value tells you about statistical significance](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html)
